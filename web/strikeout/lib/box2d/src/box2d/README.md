# Box2d-JS

* [Box2D-JS](http://sourceforge.net/projects/box2d-js/) Is a javascript port of the C++ library. It was last updated 15 May, 2008.
  * See the original demo [here](http://box2d-js.sourceforge.net/).

## Pixel Lab Box2d-JS
The folks at [Pixel Lab](http://thinkpixellab.com) modified the library to use [Google's Closure Javascript Compiler](http://code.google.com/closure/compiler/) for great compression--with the added benefit of compile-time checking. (We found a lot of bugs in the original javascript).

It's being used for [Agent 008 Ball](http://www.agent8ball.com/) - an HTML5 billiards game.

The demo site is [here](http://box2d.thinkpixellab.com/).

The demo site source, including demo code, can be found in [this Github repository](http://github.com/thinkpixellab/box2dWeb).

Please open issues or fork, fix, and send a pull request.

Happy to work with you.
