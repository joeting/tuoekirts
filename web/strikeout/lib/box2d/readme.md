# PL - A Javascript Library

By your friends at [Pixel Lab](http://thinkpixellab.com)

We do a lot of work in Javascript. This is our collection of libraries we have used and are using for projects. Where code was borrowed, we let you know. Aside from a bunch of miscellaneous, the big chunks are:

* [Box2d](https://github.com/thinkpixellab/pl/tree/master/src/box2d) - A 2D physics library
* [QR](https://github.com/thinkpixellab/pl/tree/master/src/qr) - A QR code library
* [Retained](https://github.com/thinkpixellab/pl/tree/master/src/retained) - A a [retained-mod](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retained_mode) graphics library for canvas

## Notes

* The library is designed to be used with [Google's Closure Tools](http://code.google.com/closure/).
* [KBuild](https://github.com/kevmoo/kbuild) is a sister project to make it easier to use the closure tools.

## Getting started...

*Need more here...*

To get the examples working, put a copy of the closure library in a directory named `closure` next to pl. A simple way to see how this works is to clone one of the projects below (ThinkQR is the smallest). Make sure you initialize submodules.

## Used in

* The [Box2d Demo site](https://github.com/thinkpixellab/box2dWeb)
* [Agent 008 Ball](https://github.com/thinkpixellab/agent8ball)
